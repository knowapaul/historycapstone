			<h3>An Interactive Exploration of History</h3>
			<p class="body">
				Welcome to colonialatlantic.com, where you can learn history by doing it. 	
				This website is designed to be interactive, leading the user on their own course 
				to find the answers to two key questions: how did shipping affect our nation's 
				social roots, and how did it affect our economy. Perhaps the best use of knowledge 
				of history is to help you understand current events, so after learning the answers to 
				these questions, you will hopefully have a historical basis for analysis of current 
				exploration of new frontiers, such as the potential exploration and colonization of 
				space that seems to loom in the near future. 
			</p>	
			<p class="body">
				On this website, you will find interactive timelines, maps, and graphs that aim to answer 
				the key questions. At the bottom of the page, you will find a completion tracker, which 
				allows you to know when you have completed all of the activities. When the tracker bar 
				fills up completely, you will gain access to the final conclusions of the text. As you 
				explore this website, keep in mind how the lessons of history affect our modern-day world. 
				Remember to have fun!
