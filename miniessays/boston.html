            <h3>Response to the Boston Port Act</h3>
			<p class="body">
				The Boston Port Act, a piece of legislation responding to the Boston Tea Party, was 
				largely responsible for helping to unite and incite the British colonies of North 
				America to rebellion. It also demonstrates how important the shipping industry was to 
				citizens of Boston. The act blocked commerce, except for that which had authority from 
				the King of England from entering the port. In an economy that was so centered on the 
				trans-Atlantic trade, it could not be enforced without resistance. In a letter from the 
				Boston Committee of Correspondence, leading figures in the city called for help from 
				surrounding colonies and confirmed that nearby towns in Massachusetts had already supported 
				resistance. In the postscript of the act, the writers also mention a speech that called for 
				suspended shipping with Britain, claiming that its manufacturers would have to “emigrate or 
				starve” for want of American demand for British goods. Because of the British Parliament’s 
				Boston Port Act, the colonies’ loyalties drew closer to each other and farther from Great 
				Britain.
