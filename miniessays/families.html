            <h3>Families in Colonial Boston</h3>
			<p class="body">
                Soon after the beginning of the colonial period, families began to immigrate to the United States 
                as tight groups.<sup>1</sup> Early farming centered on the family: households would expect their members 
                to help with agricultural work, and the basic unit of the economy was the family.<sup>2</sup> Despite this 
                initial unity, families became less cohesive as time progressed.<sup>3</sup> The lower infant mortality rate 
                of the American Colonies coupled with earlier marriage increased the number of dependent children 
                dramatically in the 1700s, but these children also left the home sooner to meet an increasing demand 
                for wage labor.<sup>4,5</sup> Additionally, children left the home to become sailors, a trade that fostered 
                immorality among the youth of that generation.<sup>6</sup> This gradual deterioration of traditional family 
                connections would have likely contributed to the growth of individualism in the colonies. The 
                developing society, with water travel at its roots and as one of its norms, began to move away from 
                traditional values in exchange for more modern ones.
