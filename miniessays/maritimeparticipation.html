			<p>The Role of Shipping in Colonial New England</p>
		</header>
		<div class="text">
			<p class="body">Throughout the eighteenth century, participation in the maritime economy 
			of colonial Boston had a significant effect on the society of the time, which 
			in turn affects our society today. In the early 1700s, a complex system had 
			developed to construct and load ships. ~1 This system, which linked numerous 
			different groups together - each fulfilling a specific task to create something 
			- was a predecessor to industrialism, a movement that laid the groundwork for the 
			modern consumeristic society. In addition, the supply chains which developed to 
			transport goods to consumers reflected those in use today. <br>
			The maritime economy of Boston was a community venture. Around the beginning of 
			the 17th century, one third of all adult males owned part of a vessel, and in 
			1770, exports amounted to 11 percent of the regionâ€™s income. ~2,3 Among the effects 
			of this widespread participation were that some individuals rose to the top of the 
			economy, another foreshadowing of modern capitalist goals of rising in society. 
			Maritme participation also signaled a shift away from dependence on agriculture as 
			the primary source of income in a region. (Back up with fact) Shipping had a considerable 
			influence on society because of the atmosphere of individual participation prevalent in 
			the city.
