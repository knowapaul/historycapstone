            <h3>Boston Shipbuilding</h3>
			<p class="body">
				As the colonies developed, they began to pursue their roots: just as they were initially 
				settled by ships, they would build their own. The process of building ships substantially 
				boosted the economy of the colonies and most of the town of Boston was involved in the 
				process in some way.<sup>1</sup> Although the British Empire just experimented with shipbuilding 
				in the late 1620s, it began to develop more in the 1640s. Eventually, the effect on 
				the motherland was no longer negligible; the colonies began to compete with English shipbuilders. 
				<sup>2</sup> In 1730, one sixth of English ships were built in America, and by the time of the revolution, 
				that portion had increased to one third.<sup>3</sup> The colonies had an obvious presence in the English 
				shipping market, and Boston was particularly important. Philadelphia was the only colonial port 
				that competed with Boston by the middle of the century, but it was still not as productive as
				its rival.<sup>4,5</sup> More than any other factors, the skill of Boston merchants led to this dominance.
				<sup>6</sup> This rise of shipbuilding demonstrates that colonies often develop and compete with 
				their mother countries â€“ some more than others. It also illustrates the fact that the most important 
				factors that influence towns are the people who live in them.
