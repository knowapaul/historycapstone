				An important topic to consider when discussing the influence of Boston’s maritime economy on 
				its social structure is the condition of its sailors. John Woolman, a Christian passenger 
				traveling from the Colonies to England, recorded much about his opinions of the sailors of his 
				ship in a journal. His view of them was that they were sinful and profane, but he had pity on 
				them for their condition.  
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				“I feel an openness this morning to express something further of the state of my mind in respect 
				to poor lads bound apprentice to learn the art of sailing…A pious father whose mind is exercised 
				for the everlasting welfare of his child may not with a peaceable mind place him out to an 
				employment among a people whose common course of life is manifestly corrupt and profane. Great is 
				the present defect among seafaring men in regard to virtue and piety; and, by reason of an abundant 
				traffic and many ships being used for war, so many people are employed on the sea that the subject 
				of placing lads to this employment appears very weighty.” 
			</blockquote>
			<p class="body">
				The reason for this apparent degradation of sailors may lie in how they were hired. Most sailors 
				were hired by ship captains searching for potential helpers along the waterfront.<sup>1</sup> Men willing 
				to sail the ocean were probably unattached, single men without work. Woolman records instances of 
				the sailors’ dirtiness of living and their danger and worries throughout the journey. It therefore 
				seems most men with another option for employment would avoid work as a sailor. As a result, the 
				type of men that were hired by ship captains were hardly likely to be upstanding citizens to start 
				with, but there is also a good chance that the sphere sailors worked in further degraded their 
				character. Exposure to other corrupt personalities would hardly benefit a sailor’s moral condition. 
				In conclusion, the hiring practices that were used to find sailors were not likely to find men that 
				a devout Christian would deem virtuous, and that postulate is confirmed by John Woolman’s journal.
