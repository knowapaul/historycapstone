			<h3>Maritime Participation in Boston</h3>
			<p class="body">
				Throughout the eighteenth century, participation in the maritime economy 
				of colonial Boston had a significant effect on the society of the time, which 
				in turn affects our society today. In the early 1700s, a complex system had 
				developed to construct and load ships.<sup>1</sup> This system, which linked numerous 
				different groups together - each fulfilling a specific task to create something 
				- was a predecessor to industrialism, a movement that laid the groundwork for the 
				modern consumeristic society. In addition, the supply chains which developed to 
				transport goods to consumers reflected those in use today. <br>
				The maritime economy of Boston was a community venture. Around the beginning of 
				the 17th century, one third of all adult males owned part of a vessel, and in 
				1770, exports amounted to 11 percent of the regionâ€™s income.<sup>2,3</sup> Among the effects 
				of this widespread participation were that some individuals rose to the top of the 
				economy, another foreshadowing of modern capitalist goals of rising in society. 
				Maritme participation also signaled a shift away from dependence on agriculture as 
				the primary source of income in a region.<sup>4</sup> Shipping had a considerable 
				influence on society because of the atmosphere of individual participation prevalent in 
				the city.
