            <h3>Population and Imigration in Boston</h3>
			<p class="body">
                Ships were the conduit through which Europeans immigrated to the New World. As such, they played 
                a vital role in the foundation of the United States, and it is safe to say that they contributed 
                significantly to American society. At many different points throughout the colonial era, ships 
                brought refugees to the New World. The initial migrants to Plymouth fled religious persecution, 
                enduring hardships brought on by wild animals, fierce weather, and native peoples. They made the 
                journey because they sought a better life, and they were willing to sacrifice to achieve their 
                goals.<sup>1</sup>
                <br>
                Subsequent persecution and economic hardships brought more immigrants. When they came, they both 
                built towns and developed existing towns by purchasing goods from local merchants.<sup>2</sup> 
                Fundamentally, the United States is a nation of immigrants, particularly refugees, and this is 
                perhaps one of its most defining traits. Although colonial immigration slowed after 1690, the 
                population of Boston still doubled from 1667 to 1771: a result of natural increase.<sup>3</sup> 
                This significant population growth was in part a result of low infant mortality rates, demonstrating 
                that eventually America became a welcoming place for newcomers.<sup>4</sup> The ships that delivered 
                immigrants to the New World were their primary means of finding a better life. Not only did ships 
                permanently affect American society, but without them, it would not exist.
