            <h3>Boston's Major Exports</h3>
			<p class="body">
				One key element of the development of Colonial Boston was the goods that it exported. 
				Shipping would not have existed if there had not been any cargo, so the influence of 
				ships and shipping can be traced back to the cargo that vessels transported. In the 
				second half of the 18th century, Boston led all the cities in the export of shoes and 
				furniture, but these goods only made up a small portion of the town’s exports.<sup>1</sup> In 1770, 
				exports consisted of about 11.1% of New England’s total regional earnings. These exports, 
				however, included the trade of “invisibles,” intangible products such as shipping services.<sup>2</sup> 
				Additionally, private travel appears to have been common in those times.<sup>3</sup>
				The importance of shipping in the local economy is demonstrated by the Boston Port Act. When 
				it was enacted, this piece of legislation prohibited all trade into Boston – a restriction which 
				hurt the city so much that it was incited to rebellion.<sup>4</sup> It is undeniable that trade, both 
				physical and intangible was very important to Boston’s economy. By the time of the revolution, 
				it had developed an identity as a maritime economy.
