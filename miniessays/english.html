            <h3>English Economic Influence on Boston</h3>
			<p class="body">
                In the 1700s, the colonies’ interactions with England simultaneously developed their 
                economy and began to separate them from the empire’s influence. As the century progressed, 
                artisans from the shipbuilding industry in England arrived in the United States, and colonial
                purchasing power soared above that of the mother country.<sup>1,2</sup> In addition, increasing competition
                between England and her colonies furthered the economic separation between the regions. Although 
                the Navigation Acts passed by Parliament helped the English shipbuilding industry to recover, they 
                also promoted the growth of the North American construction of vessels which began to compete with 
                the former as early as 1724.<sup>3,4</sup>> Indeed, by 1730, one-sixth of English merchant ships were built 
                in the colonies.<sup>5</sup>!SB! Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that in the absence of competition 
                with the motherland, the United States would have become an entirely different nation.
